# waVey

This is a fun side project about converting texts to sound waves using python.

#### How does it work ?

First I use the [gTTS](https://pypi.org/project/gTTS/) Library to interface with Google Translate's text-to-speech API that way I can extract the audio and save it to an mp3 file, then I use [LibROSA](https://librosa.github.io/librosa/) package to extract the waveform and the sampling rate / frequency, then I use [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) library to generate the plot of the sound wave in terms of time and frequency.

#### Additional / Fun tweaks :
      âž•You can use any language supported by Google Translate
      âž•You can change the sound waves color
      âž•You can change the Background Color of the resulted image to match the sound waves color ;)
